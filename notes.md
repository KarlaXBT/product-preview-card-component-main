# workflow

1. Understand the Challenge Requirements
   Read the README provided by Frontend Mentor.

Open the design/ folder and inspect the screenshots (mobile + desktop).

Note any functionality requirements (e.g., responsive layout, form validation).

List out:

Required pages or sections

Components (like cards, buttons, navbars, etc.)

Breakpoints for responsiveness

‚úçÔ∏è Tip: Write these down in a NOTES.md or at the top of your README.md.

2. Set Up Your Project Environment
   Make sure you have your preferred stack ready (e.g., HTML + CSS + JS or using a framework like React or Tailwind).

Create the necessary folders:

bash
Kopeeri
Redigeeri
/images
/styles
/scripts (if needed)
index.html
Link your CSS and JS properly in index.html.

‚úÖ Commit: "Initial project structure setup"

3. Build a Static HTML Skeleton
   Ignore styles for now. Focus on writing semantic HTML that structures the page based on the mockups.

Use headings, sections, articles, buttons, etc., appropriately.

Use placeholder content if needed.

‚úÖ Commit: "Added basic HTML structure"

4. Add Base Styles
   Start styling global elements:

Reset/normalize styles

Set fonts, colors, and typography based on style-guide.md (from the challenge)

Layout containers

Use custom properties (CSS variables) for colors and fonts if possible.

‚úÖ Commit: "Added base styles and variables"

5. Style Component by Component
   Use a mobile-first approach:

Pick one component at a time (e.g., a card or section)

Style for mobile view first

Repeat for all components/sections

‚úÖ Commit after each major component: e.g. "Styled header section (mobile)"

6. Add Responsiveness
   Use media queries to style for desktop or tablet views.

Adjust layout, spacing, font sizes, etc.

Test using browser dev tools.

‚úÖ Commit: "Added responsive styles"

7. Add Interactivity (if needed)
   If the challenge has:

Toggle menus

Form validation

Accordions or sliders
Do this after the layout is done.

‚úÖ Commit: "Added JS for [feature]"

8. Final QA and Polish
   Check spacing and alignment

Test all breakpoints

Optimize images

Run through Frontend Mentor checklist

‚úÖ Commit: "Final polish and cleanup"

9. Deploy & Submit
   Deploy using GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify

Add live link to your README

Submit your solution on Frontend Mentor

‚úÖ Commit: "Prepared project for deployment"

üß† Bonus Tips:
Use version control well: Commit often and write descriptive messages.

Create a checklist in your README or project notes to track progress.

If you're stuck, inspect similar websites or go step-by-step in DevTools.
